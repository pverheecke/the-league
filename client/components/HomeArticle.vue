            In the modern era, there never has been a longer expansion drought.<br><br> \
            Perhaps once the stadium situations involving Oakland and Tampa Bay are settled, \
            baseball will consider expanding for the first time since admitting the \
            Diamondbacks and Rays in 1998. (Itâ€™s possible that teams like Tampa or Oakland \
            would relocate, but research by Craig Edwards earlier this week revealed how \
            infrequently MLB teams change addresses.) Perhaps now that baseball owners have \
            cashed in some of their investment in MLB Advanced Media, expansion talk will \
            become more serious in the coming years.\
